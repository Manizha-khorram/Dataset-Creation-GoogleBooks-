Physics of Data Science and Machine Learning,Ijaz A. Rauf,CRC Press,2021-11-28,"Physics of Data Science and Machine Learning links fundamental concepts of physics to data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence for physicists looking to integrate these techniques into their work. This book is written explicitly for physicists, marrying quantum and statistical mechanics with modern data mining, data science, and machine learning. It also explains how to integrate these techniques into the design of experiments, while exploring neural networks and machine learning, building on fundamental concepts of statistical and quantum mechanics. This book is a self-learning tool for physicists looking to learn how to utilize data science and machine learning in their research. It will also be of interest to computer scientists and applied mathematicians, alongside graduate students looking to understand the basic concepts and foundations of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Although specifically written for physicists, it will also help provide non-physicists with an opportunity to understand the fundamental concepts from a physics perspective to aid in the development of new and innovative machine learning and artificial intelligence tools. Key Features: Introduces the design of experiments and digital twin concepts in simple lay terms for physicists to understand, adopt, and adapt. Free from endless derivations; instead, equations are presented and it is explained strategically why it is imperative to use them and how they will help in the task at hand. Illustrations and simple explanations help readers visualize and absorb the difficult-to-understand concepts. Ijaz A.
